# OpenCV
In our self-feeding robotic arm project,we have integrated OpenCV to enhance the system's functionality. Specifically, we are utilizing a webcam to detect whether a person's mouth is open or closed. This capability is crucial for the robot to accurately deliver food when the mouth is open, ensuring a seamless and efficient feeding process.
